# ML Pipeline Expert

## Codex Usage

When using this skill in Codex:
1. Read this SKILL.md before starting the task.
2. Read AGENTS.md if it exists.
3. Inspect relevant project files before editing.
4. Make the smallest safe change that satisfies the task.
5. Prefer explicit, testable changes over broad rewrites.
6. Run relevant tests, linters, type checks, or explain why they were not run.
7. End with:
   - Files changed
   - Tests/checks run
   - Assumptions
   - Remaining risks
   - Suggested next step

## Trigger Guidance

Use this skill when the task involves:
- ML pipeline
- MLflow
- Kubeflow
- feature engineering
- model training
- experiment tracking

Do not use this skill when:
- The task is unrelated to this skill's domain
- A simpler general coding response is enough
- The skill would add unnecessary process or context bloat

Senior ML pipeline engineer specializing in production-grade machine learning infrastructure, orchestration systems, and automated training workflows.

## Core Workflow

1. **Design pipeline architecture** â€” Map data flow, identify stages, define interfaces between components
2. **Validate data schema** â€” Run schema checks and distribution validation before any training begins; halt and report on failures
3. **Implement feature engineering** â€” Build transformation pipelines, feature stores, and validation checks
4. **Orchestrate training** â€” Configure distributed training, hyperparameter tuning, and resource allocation
5. **Track experiments** â€” Log metrics, parameters, and artifacts; enable comparison and reproducibility
6. **Validate and deploy** â€” Run model evaluation gates; implement A/B testing or shadow deployment before promotion

## Code Templates

### MLflow Experiment Logging (minimal reproducible example)

```python
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score
import numpy as np

# Pin random state for reproducibility
SEED = 42
np.random.seed(SEED)

mlflow.set_experiment("my-classifier-experiment")

with mlflow.start_run():
    # Log all hyperparameters â€” never hardcode silently
    params = {"n_estimators": 100, "max_depth": 5, "random_state": SEED}
    mlflow.log_params(params)

    model = RandomForestClassifier(**params)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    preds = model.predict(X_test)

    # Log metrics
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy_score(y_test, preds))
    mlflow.log_metric("f1", f1_score(y_test, preds, average="weighted"))

    # Log and register the model artifact
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, artifact_path="model",
                             registered_model_name="my-classifier")
```

### Kubeflow Pipeline Component (single-step template)

```python
from kfp.v2 import dsl
from kfp.v2.dsl import component, Input, Output, Dataset, Model, Metrics

@component(base_image="python:3.10", packages_to_install=["scikit-learn", "mlflow"])
def train_model(
    train_data: Input[Dataset],
    model_output: Output[Model],
    metrics_output: Output[Metrics],
    n_estimators: int = 100,
    max_depth: int = 5,
):
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    import pickle, json

    df = pd.read_csv(train_data.path)
    X, y = df.drop("label", axis=1), df["label"]

    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=n_estimators,
                                   max_depth=max_depth, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X, y)

    with open(model_output.path, "wb") as f:
        pickle.dump(model, f)

    metrics_output.log_metric("train_samples", len(df))

@dsl.pipeline(name="training-pipeline")
def training_pipeline(data_path: str, n_estimators: int = 100):
    train_step = train_model(n_estimators=n_estimators)
    # Chain additional steps (validate, register, deploy) here
```

### Data Validation Checkpoint (Great Expectations style)

```python
import great_expectations as ge

def validate_training_data(df):
    """Run schema and distribution checks. Raise on failure â€” never skip."""
    gdf = ge.from_pandas(df)
    results = gdf.expect_column_values_to_not_be_null("label")
    results &= gdf.expect_column_values_to_be_between("feature_1", 0, 1)

    if not results["success"]:
        raise ValueError(f"Data validation failed: {results['result']}")
    return df  # safe to proceed to training
```

## Constraints

**Always:**
- Version all data, code, and models explicitly (DVC, Git tags, model registry)
- Pin dependencies and random seeds for reproducible training environments
- Log all hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts to experiment tracking
- Validate data schema and distribution before training begins
- Use containerized environments; store credentials in secrets managers, never in code
- Implement error handling, retry logic, and pipeline alerting
- Separate training and inference code clearly

**Never:**
- Run training without experiment tracking or without logging hyperparameters
- Deploy a model without recorded validation metrics
- Use non-reproducible random states or skip data validation
- Ignore pipeline failures silently or mix credentials into pipeline code

## Output Format

When implementing a pipeline, provide:
1. Complete pipeline definition (Kubeflow DAG, Airflow DAG, or equivalent) â€” use the templates above as starting structure
2. Feature engineering code with inline data validation calls
3. Training script with MLflow (or equivalent) experiment logging
4. Model evaluation code with explicit pass/fail thresholds
5. Deployment configuration and rollback strategy
6. Brief explanation of architecture decisions and reproducibility measures
